# Next Thin Slices

## Purpose
Maintain a phase-agnostic, execution-first queue of immediate slices.

Use this as the active implementation plan when roadmap phase ordering may change.

Detailed implementation plan for the next adapter track:
- `ops/phase-4-1-thin-slices.md`

## Status
- Phase 4.1 / Slice 0 - OpenAI-Compatible Adapter Contract and Env Spec: queued
- Phase 4.1 / Slice 1 - Adapter Skeleton and Config Validation: queued
- Phase 4.1 / Slice 2 - Request/Response Path: queued
- Phase 4.1 / Slice 3 - Registry and CLI Integration: queued
- Phase 4.1 / Slice 4 - Error Handling and Diagnostics: queued
- Phase 4.1 / Slice 5 - Docs and Consumer Usage: queued
- Phase 4.1 / Slice 6 - Regression and Contract Gates: queued
- Phase 4.1 / Slice 7 - Exit Validation and Handoff: queued
- Next / Phase 5 Slice 1 - GitHub App Skeleton: queued

## Next Actions
1. Execute Phase 4.1 slices in `ops/phase-4-1-thin-slices.md`.
2. Start Phase 5 Slice 1 only after Phase 4.1 exit validation is done.

## Mapping Notes
- `ops/ROADMAP.md` remains the strategic phase plan.
- `ops/phase-5-thin-slices.md` remains phase-specific draft/detail.
- This file is the active execution queue and may pull slices from different phases.
